## Approach
This problem can be treated as a binary calssification where the target is SeriousDlqin2yrs. 
- First, I analyzed the dataset. There are two columns that have null variables. I filled out null values with most occurring value in the column. To reduce the prediction variable and boost the predictive capacity I group some of values in a few columns. 
- Then, I used a few models to fit onto the models. As the dataset is very skewed, I resample the dataset to balance the dataset in combination with cross validation. 
- I chose the ROC and PR curve to show the skill of the model. The highest accuracy achieved was about 68 percent with â€¦ model.
- The attached ipython shows every step and its results.
